Auto_invoicing

Python is required to run this program

Start a virtual environment
  python -m venv venv

Source that virtual environment
  source venv/bin/activate (linux/mac)
  venv\Scripts\activate (windows)

Install packages included in requirements.txt
  pip install -r requirement.txt  
    (I had to upgrade setuptools for weasyprint to work 'pip install --upgrade setuptools')
